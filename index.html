<center><h1>HELPING TEENS</h1></center>

<h2> My cause is to have high school students be more aware of teen pregnancy. Having the young teens know about the effects that this can cause to them. Also having them know about pretection and what they can do to prevent this</h2>
<h2> What I would like to achieve is making sure that as adults we can help these teenagers be more aware and making sure they ask any questions about sexual intercorces and pertections. Also teaching them how to prevent teen pregnancy. I wish for us as adults to volunteer to talk to kids through online chats if they are too shy to ask their parents.</h2>
